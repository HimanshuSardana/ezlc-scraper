# Substring with Concatenation of All Words
## Description
You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.
A **concatenated string** is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.
	For example, if `words = [&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;cd&quot;,&quot;ef&quot;]`, then `&quot;abcdef&quot;`, `&quot;abefcd&quot;`, `&quot;cdabef&quot;`, `&quot;cdefab&quot;`, `&quot;efabcd&quot;`, and `&quot;efcdab&quot;` are all concatenated strings. `&quot;acdbef&quot;` is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.
Return an array of *the starting indices* of all the concatenated substrings in `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.
 
Example 1:**

**Input:** s = &quot;barfoothefoobarman&quot;, words = [&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;]
**Output:** [0,9]
**Explanation:**
The substring starting at 0 is `&quot;barfoo&quot;`. It is the concatenation of `[&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;]` which is a permutation of `words`.
The substring starting at 9 is `&quot;foobar&quot;`. It is the concatenation of `[&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;]` which is a permutation of `words`.

Example 2:**

**Input:** s = &quot;wordgoodgoodgoodbestword&quot;, words = [&quot;word&quot;,&quot;good&quot;,&quot;best&quot;,&quot;word&quot;]
**Output:** []
**Explanation:**
There is no concatenated substring.

Example 3:**

**Input:** s = &quot;barfoofoobarthefoobarman&quot;, words = [&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;the&quot;]
**Output:** [6,9,12]
**Explanation:**
The substring starting at 6 is `&quot;foobarthe&quot;`. It is the concatenation of `[&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;the&quot;]`.
The substring starting at 9 is `&quot;barthefoo&quot;`. It is the concatenation of `[&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;the&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;]`.
The substring starting at 12 is `&quot;thefoobar&quot;`. It is the concatenation of `[&quot;the&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;]`.

 
**Constraints:**
	`1 4`
	`1 
	`1 
	`s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
