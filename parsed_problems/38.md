# Count and Say
## Description
The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
	`countAndSay(1) = &quot;1&quot;`
	`countAndSay(n)` is the run-length encoding of `countAndSay(n - 1)`.
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string `&quot;3322251&quot;` we replace `&quot;33&quot;` with `&quot;23&quot;`, replace `&quot;222&quot;` with `&quot;32&quot;`, replace `&quot;5&quot;` with `&quot;15&quot;` and replace `&quot;1&quot;` with `&quot;11&quot;`. Thus the compressed string becomes `&quot;23321511&quot;`.
Given a positive integer `n`, return *the *`nth`* element of the **count-and-say** sequence*.
 
Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4
**Output:** &quot;1211&quot;
**Explanation:**
```
countAndSay(1) = &quot;1&quot;
countAndSay(2) = RLE of &quot;1&quot; = &quot;11&quot;
countAndSay(3) = RLE of &quot;11&quot; = &quot;21&quot;
countAndSay(4) = RLE of &quot;21&quot; = &quot;1211&quot;
```

Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1
**Output:** &quot;1&quot;
**Explanation:**
This is the base case.
