# Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
## Description
Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.
 
Example 1:**
```
**Input:** haystack = &quot;sadbutsad&quot;, needle = &quot;sad&quot;
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** &quot;sad&quot; occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
```
Example 2:**
```
**Input:** haystack = &quot;leetcode&quot;, needle = &quot;leeto&quot;
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** &quot;leeto&quot; did not occur in &quot;leetcode&quot;, so we return -1.
```
 
**Constraints:**
	`1 4`
	`haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.
