# Permutation Sequence
## Description
The set `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` contains a total of `n!` unique permutations.
By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for `n = 3`:

	`&quot;123&quot;`
	`&quot;132&quot;`
	`&quot;213&quot;`
	`&quot;231&quot;`
	`&quot;312&quot;`
	`&quot;321&quot;`

Given `n` and `k`, return the `kth` permutation sequence.
 
Example 1:**
```**Input:** n = 3, k = 3
**Output:** "213"
```Example 2:**
```**Input:** n = 4, k = 9
**Output:** "2314"
```Example 3:**
```**Input:** n = 3, k = 1
**Output:** "123"
```
 
**Constraints:**
	`1 
	`1
