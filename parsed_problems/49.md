# Group Anagrams
## Description
Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in **any order**.
 
Example 1:**

**Input:** strs = [&quot;eat&quot;,&quot;tea&quot;,&quot;tan&quot;,&quot;ate&quot;,&quot;nat&quot;,&quot;bat&quot;]
**Output:** [[&quot;bat&quot;],[&quot;nat&quot;,&quot;tan&quot;],[&quot;ate&quot;,&quot;eat&quot;,&quot;tea&quot;]]
**Explanation:**

	The strings `&quot;nat&quot;` and `&quot;tan&quot;` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
	The strings `&quot;ate&quot;`, `&quot;eat&quot;`, and `&quot;tea&quot;` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
