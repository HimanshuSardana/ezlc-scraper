# Minimum Window Substring
## Description
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window*** ***substring**** of *`s`* such that every character in *`t`* (**including duplicates**) is included in the window*. If there is no such substring, return *the empty string *`&quot;&quot;`.
The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.
 
Example 1:**
```
**Input:** s = &quot;ADOBECODEBANC&quot;, t = &quot;ABC&quot;
**Output:** &quot;BANC&quot;
**Explanation:** The minimum window substring &quot;BANC&quot; includes &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, and &#39;C&#39; from string t.
```
Example 2:**
```
**Input:** s = &quot;a&quot;, t = &quot;a&quot;
**Output:** &quot;a&quot;
**Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.
```
Example 3:**
```
**Input:** s = &quot;a&quot;, t = &quot;aa&quot;
**Output:** &quot;&quot;
**Explanation:** Both &#39;a&#39;s from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one &#39;a&#39;, return empty string.
```
 
**Constraints:**
	`m == s.length`
	`n == t.length`
	`1 5`
	`s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
 
**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?
